----------PLOT----------

1.1 - BACKGROUND:
Ye Oldy England (though not actually set on Earth, just earthlike). Main character is a young boy who's civilisation is struggling to cope with never-ending darkness - for some reason, the sun's not risen for 3 days streight. Crops are failing, everyone's getting pretty miserable, and nobody really knows what to do.
1.2 - OBJECTIVE: 
Your characters aim is to solve the mystery of the missing sun/find a way to bring it back. Only trouble is your civilisation has always been afraid of the moonlight - makes people go crazy.
1.3 - SPOILERVILLE:
You find out that your civilisation used to worship the sun in grand temples,  but now doesn't. This 'Angered the Sun God' who has just decided to leave you alone. The only way that you can think to get the sun back is to make a human sacrifice - you (maybe give the player an option to sacrifice someone else instead?). You do this without knowing if there even is a sun God but see it as the only way to try and save your civilisation.
